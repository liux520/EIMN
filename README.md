## :bulb: Abstract
![main figure](images/net.png)

> **Abstract:** Recent researches have shown that the success of Transformers comes from their macro-level framework and advanced components, not just their self-attention (SA) mechanism. Comparable results can be obtained by replacing SA with spatial pooling, shifting, MLP, fourier transform and constant matrix, all of which have spatial information encoding capability like SA. In light of these findings, this work focuses on combining efficient spatial information encoding technology with superior macro architectures in Transformers. 
> We rethink spatial convolution to achieve more efficient encoding of spatial features and dynamic modulation value representations by convolutional modulation techniques. The large-kernel convolution and Hadamard product are utilizated in the proposed Multi-orders Long-range convolutional modulation (MOLRCM) layer to imitate the implementation of SA. Moreover, MOLRCM layer also achieve long-range correlations and self-adaptation behavior, similar to SA, with linear complexity. On the other hand, we also address the sub-optimality of vanilla feed-forward networks (FFN) by introducing spatial awareness and locality, improving feature diversity, and regulating information flow between layers in the proposed Spatial Awareness Dynamic Feature Flow Modulation (SADFFM) layer. Experiment results show that our proposed efficient information modulation network (EIMN) performs better both quantitatively and qualitatively.

## :computer: Usage

### 0. Dataset Preparation

- The dataset for training can be downloaded here [DIV2K](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) and [Flickr2K](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/research/EDSR/Flickr2K.tar).

- The dataset for testing can be downloaded here [BasicSR.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B3DJGQKB6eNdwuQIhdskA64qUuVKLZ9u)

- It is recommended to symlink the dataset root to `Datasets` with the follow command:

  For Linux: `ln -s [Your Dataset Path] [EIMN Project Path/Datasets]` 

  For Windows: `mklink /d [EIMN Project Path\Datasets] [Your Dataset Path]`   (In administrator mode)

- The file structure is as follows:

### 1. Evaluation
Download the pretrained weights here and run the following command for evaluation on five widely-used Benchmark datasets.
```
python Demo/inference.py 
```
If you just want to generate an image, you can run demo.py.
```
python Demo/demo.py 
```

### 2. Training

- Training the model **EIMN_L** with scale factor 2

```

--patch_size 128 128  --scale_factor 2 --workers 4 --dataset DF2K  --lr 0.0005 --lr_scheduler cos  --warmup_epochs 0

```

- Tips on the training or finetuning.

```
x2 scale: 
(a) HR patches of size 128 Ã— 128 are randomly cropped from HR images. The mini-batch size and lr are set to 16 and 5e-4. This process repeats third. (The model is initialized with the pretrained weights, and trained with the same settings as the previous step.)
(b) The model is initialized with the pretrained weights obtained from (a). The parameters patch_size and lr are set to 128 x 128 and 1e-4. This process repeats second.  
(c) The model is initialized with the pretrained obtained weights from (b). The parameters patch_size and lr are set to 192 x 192 and 5e-5. This process repeats second.
```
```
x3 scale:
(a) The models for different SR scales (x2, x3, and x4) have identical structures, except for the tail module which consists of unique convolution and pixel shuffle layers. Consequently, when we have a pretrained x2 model, we can directly transfer its weights to the x3 and x4 models instead of training them from scratch. Since the tail modules are not shared, we initially fine-tune only the randomly initialized tail module while keeping the other layers frozen until convergence, which typically takes less than 1 hour. Subsequently, we fine-tune the entire model using a patch size of 288Ã—288 and a lr of 1e-4.
(b) The same training settings are kept to train the model, except that the lr is set to 5e-5.
```
```
x4 scale:
(a) After loading the pre-training weights from the x3 scale, we proceed to finetune the entire model using a patch size of 384Ã—384 and a lr of 1e-4.
(b) The same training settings are kept to train the model, except that the lr is set to 5e-5.
```
